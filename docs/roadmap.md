# Roadmap

## Phase 0: Decision (NOW)
- [x] Repo created
- [ ] Engine selected (Godot vs Unity)
- [ ] Genre/mechanic locked
- [ ] First prototype scope defined

**Target:** Today

---

## Phase 1: Prototyping (Days 1-7)
- [ ] Install engine, create first scene
- [ ] Prototype 1: Core mechanic test
- [ ] Prototype 2: Variation A
- [ ] Prototype 3: Variation B
- [ ] Playtest + pick winner
- [ ] Document why winner won

**Deliverable:** 3 working prototypes, 1 selected

---

## Phase 2: MVP (Days 8-21)
- [ ] Feature scope locked (what's in, what's out)
- [ ] Core loop complete
- [ ] Win/lose conditions working
- [ ] Basic UI (start, game over, score)
- [ ] Placeholder art/audio acceptable
- [ ] Playable build exported

**Deliverable:** MVP build, shareable, playable

---

## Phase 3: Polish (Days 22-28)
- [ ] Juice: Screenshake, particles, sfx
- [ ] Balance: Difficulty curve tuned
- [ ] Bug fixes: No crashes, no soft locks
- [ ] Art pass: Better than placeholder
- [ ] Audio pass: Satisfying sounds

**Deliverable:** Shippable candidate

---

## Phase 4: Ship (Days 29-30)
- [ ] Final build exported (all platforms)
- [ ] Store pages drafted (itch.io, etc.)
- [ ] Screenshots/video captured
- [ ] Published
- [ ] Post-mortem written

**Deliverable:** LIVE GAME + lessons learned

---

## Post-Ship (Day 31+)

**Options:**
- **Kill it:** Learned what we needed, move to next game
- **Iterate it:** Add features based on feedback
- **Port it:** Mobile, web, console

**Decision criteria:** Downloads, ratings, personal interest

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep | HIGH | HIGH | Hard 30-day deadline |
| Engine learning curve | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Godot for speed |
| Art/audio bottleneck | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Placeholders acceptable |
| Motivation drop | HIGH | CRITICAL | Daily commits, streaks |
| Perfectionism | HIGH | HIGH | "Ship ugly, fix later" |

---

## Streak Rules

- **Every day:** Commit something to this repo
- **No commits:** Streak broken, NAPOLEON escalates
- **Commit size doesn't matter:** 1 line or 100, just move

---

*Ship date is non-negotiable. Features are negotiable.*
