# First Game

**Engine:** Godot 4.x  
**Language:** GDScript  
**Goal:** Ship MVP in 30 days. Iterate or kill. No perfectionism.

---

## The Standard

This is not a side project. This is the foundation of Domain 3 (Games/Coding).  
**Greatness is the damn standard.** Mediocrity gets deleted. Half-effort is betrayal.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install Godot 4.x:** https://godotengine.org/download
2. **Open this folder** as project in Godot
3. **Run the prototype:** Press F5 or click "Play"
4. **Iterate:** See roadmap.md for milestones

## Genre Decision — NEXT

Now that engine is locked, we need the **core mechanic**. NOD one:

**A) PLATFORMER** — Jump, run, simple levels. Classic, proven, fast to prototype.  
**B) PUZZLE** — One mechanic, deep interactions. Brain teaser, high retention.  
**C) ENDLESS RUNNER** — Auto-scroll, dodge obstacles. Mobile-friendly, arcade feel.  
**D) NARRATIVE/CHOICE** — Story-driven, dialogue choices. Leverages your novelist skill.

**My recommendation: A or C.** Both are "feel" games — you know in 5 seconds if they're fun. No art required for prototypes.

**NOD A/B/C/D. Then we build the first scene.**

## Cross-Domain Links

- **Book tie-in:** Could novel themes (filmmaking, architecture, relationships) inspire game narrative?
- **Campaign tie-in:** TX-35 voter engagement mini-game? Policy education through play?
- **Metaverse tie-in:** Web export → Spatial/Decentraland integration?
- **Fitness gamification:** Daily workout = in-game reward?
