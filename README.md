# First Game

**Engine:** Godot 4.x  
**Language:** GDScript  
**Goal:** Ship MVP in 30 days. Iterate or kill. No perfectionism.

---

## The Standard

This is not a side project. This is the foundation of Domain 3 (Games/Coding).  
**Greatness is the damn standard.** Mediocrity gets deleted. Half-effort is betrayal.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Install Godot 4.x:** https://godotengine.org/download
2. **Open this folder** as project in Godot
3. **Run the prototype:** Press F5 or click "Play"
4. **Iterate:** See roadmap.md for milestones

## Genre: ENDLESS RUNNER — LOCKED ✅

**Why endless runner:**
- 30-second play sessions = Lyft driver friendly
- One input (jump) = zero learning curve
- High score = natural viral/share mechanic
- Fastest path to "fun" — you feel it immediately or pivot

**Current Prototype:** `prototypes/prototype_02.tscn`
- Auto-scroll world
- Jump to dodge red obstacles
- Score based on survival time
- Game over on collision
- Space to restart

---

## Cross-Domain Links

- **Book tie-in:** Could novel themes (filmmaking, architecture, relationships) inspire game narrative?
- **Campaign tie-in:** TX-35 voter engagement mini-game? Policy education through play?
- **Metaverse tie-in:** Web export → Spatial/Decentraland integration?
- **Fitness gamification:** Daily workout = in-game reward?

## Streak Tracker

```
🎮 GAME DEV STREAK: Day 1 ✅
🎯 Current: Repo + Godot selected
📦 Next: Godot installed + first scene running
🔥 Daily commit required: YES
```

**No commit today = streak broken. Don't break the streak.**
