# First Game

**Working Title:** TBD  
**Genre:** TBD — Decision needed  
**Engine:** Godot (recommended) / Unity (alternative)  
**Goal:** Ship MVP in 30 days. Iterate or kill. No perfectionism.

---

## The Standard

This is not a side project. This is the foundation of Domain 3 (Games/Coding).  
**Greatness is the standard.** Mediocrity gets deleted. Half-effort is betrayal.

---

## Quick Start

1. Install Godot 4.x: https://godotengine.org/
2. Open this folder as project
3. Start with `prototypes/` — test mechanics fast
4. Graduate working code to `src/`
5. Ship.

## Current Status

| Milestone | Status | Date |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Repo created | ✅ DONE | Today |
| Engine decision | 🟡 PENDING | Need nod |
| First prototype | ⚪ NOT STARTED | Blocked on engine |
| MVP scope defined | ⚪ NOT STARTED | Blocked on genre |

## Engine Decision — NOD REQUIRED

**Option A: GODOT**  
- Free, open-source, lightweight  
- GDScript (Python-like) — fast to learn  
- Perfect for 2D, good for 3D  
- Export to web/mobile/desktop free  
- **BEST FOR:** Shipping fast, learning, 2D focus

**Option B: UNITY**  
- Industry standard, massive ecosystem  
- C# — transferable skill  
- Better for complex 3D, physics-heavy games  
- Free until $200k revenue, then royalties  
- **BEST FOR:** Scale, 3D, long-term career skill

**RECOMMENDATION:** Godot. You need velocity, not complexity. Ship one game, then decide if Unity is worth the overhead.

**NOD A or B. Then we prototype.**

---

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **NOD engine choice** — Unblocks all downstream work
2. **Define genre/mechanic** — What exists in 30 seconds of gameplay?
3. **First prototype** — One mechanic, one screen, no art
4. **Iterate or pivot** — 3 prototypes, pick winner
5. **MVP scope lock** — Feature freeze, ship date set

## Cross-Domain Links

- **Book tie-in:** Could novel themes (filmmaking, architecture, relationships) inspire game narrative?
- **Campaign tie-in:** TX-35 voter engagement mini-game? Policy education through play?
- **Metaverse tie-in:** Web export → Spatial/Decentraland integration?
- **Fitness gamification:** Daily workout = in-game reward?

*Ideas documented in `docs/synergies.md` when ready.*
